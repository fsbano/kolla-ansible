    Neutron agent wrappers are now enabled by default. The wrapper containers
    restart DHCP, L3, and related agents without having to respawn the main
    service containers, which reduces dataplane disruptions during upgrades and
    restarts. Operators who need the previous behaviour can set
    ``neutron_agents_wrappers`` to ``"no"`` in ``/etc/kolla/globals.yml``.
